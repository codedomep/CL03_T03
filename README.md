## Data Visualisation Project Process Book and Website

###The focus of our study is to examine patterns in infant health in Australia, specifically in relation to rates of birth, mortality, and immunisation. We offer comprehensive visual representations to support health researchers, policymakers, and public health authorities in their efforts to enhance newborn health outcomes. Our visual tools consistently identify regions that require health interventions and assess the effectiveness of immunisation programmes by providing a precise, data-driven view on tracking changes in newborn health. The project utilises data sourced from national health databases and public records, and presents it in a diverse range of graphical representations to enhance accessibility and comprehension.
